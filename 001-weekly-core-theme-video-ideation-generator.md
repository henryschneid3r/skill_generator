# Weekly Core Theme & Video Ideation Generator

## 1. Description

A systematic AI-driven workflow skill designed for software developers creating Instagram video content. It ingests recent tech industry developments, trending discussions, and the creator's core engineering focus to synthesize a unified **Weekly Core Theme**. From this central theme, it breaks down and distills distinct content tracks (Groups A, B, and C) to form a complete, structured content pipeline for the week.

## 2. Purpose

To eliminate content planning friction for technical creators by combining proactive topical relevance (what happened in the last few days) with strategic consistency, ensuring every weekly content batch is both timely and aligned with developer expertise.

## 3. Scope

* **Domain:** Content Creation, Social Media Strategy, Software Engineering, Trend Analysis.
* **Target Platforms:** Instagram Reels / Short-form video.
* **Output Span:** 1 Weekly Core Theme + 3 Content Groups (A, B, C) with individual video concepts.

## 4. Trigger Conditions

* Explicit requests to define the week's theme, plan weekly content, or review recent tech news for video ideas.
* Variations of: *"What is the main core idea of this week?"* or *"Help me plan my tech videos for this week."*

## 5. Non-Trigger Conditions

* General script writing for a single, pre-determined video topic without a weekly strategy framework.
* Long-form technical documentation or blog post outlining.
* Non-tech related content planning.

## 6. Inputs

### Required

* **Creator Niche / Focus Area:** The specific technical domains, languages, or engineering perspectives the developer focuses on (e.g., backend systems, Python, DevOps, AI engineering).

### Optional

* **Target Audience Level:** Beginner, intermediate, or senior engineers.
* **Specific Events to Include:** Particular major tech news, framework releases, or outages the creator specifically wants covered.

### Contextual

* Current date and recent historical window (past 3–7 days).

### Automatically Derived

* Recent high-impact software engineering news, trending developer discussions, GitHub releases, or industry shifts from the past 7 days.
* Reasonable default content pillars (e.g., Pillar A: Core Tech/Architecture, Pillar B: Practical Tooling/Coding, Pillar C: Developer Lifestyle/Career).

## 7. Outputs

A structured operational markdown document containing:

1. **The Weekly Core Theme:** A single compelling, overarching narrative or thesis for the week.
2. **Context & Relevance Rationale:** Why this theme matters *now* based on recent events.
3. **Content Group Breakdown:**
* **Group A (Deep Dive / Architectural / Educational):** Complex engineering concepts or systems thinking.
* **Group B (Practical / Tactical / Viral Videos):** Tooling, shortcuts, code snippets, or workflows.
* **Group C (Perspective / Industry Commentary):** Opinions, career advice, or reactions to recent industry events.


4. **Actionable Video Briefs:** 3–4 specific video angles with hooks, core message points, and visual suggestions.

## 8. Core Principles

* **Timeliness + Evergreen Value:** Balance breaking developments with foundational software engineering principles.
* **Developer Authenticity:** Maintain technical accuracy; avoid superficial clickbait that misrepresents engineering realities.
* **Modular Breakdown:** Every piece of content must trace cleanly back to the Weekly Core Theme.

## 9. Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering & Trend Scanning

* **Objective:** Identify what major developments, discussions, or releases occurred in the software engineering world over the past 3–7 days.
* **Actions:** Scan technical news spaces, major framework release logs, and developer sentiment patterns.
* **Expected Result:** A list of 3–5 candidate current events or trending topics.

### Phase 2: Core Theme Synthesis

* **Objective:** Merge current relevance with the creator's primary technical domain to establish a single unified **Weekly Core Theme**.
* **Decision Point:** If no major breaking news dominates, default to an evergreen architectural or productivity challenge currently facing backend/software engineers.
* **Expected Result:** A definitive statement representing "The Main Core Idea of the Week."

### Phase 3: Content Group Distribution

* **Objective:** Distill the core theme into three distinct content angles (Groups A, B, and C) to prevent content monotony.
* **Actions:** Map the core theme across technical depth (A), practical utility (B), and perspective/commentary (C).
* **Expected Result:** Three distinct content tracks ready for granular expansion.

### Phase 4: Final Output Generation

* **Objective:** Format the output into a clear, scannable, copy-pasteable execution sheet for the creator.

## 10. Decision Logic

* **IF** a major global tech outage or zero-day vulnerability occurred in the last 48 hours **THEN** make that the anchor of the Weekly Core Theme.
* **IF** no major news occurred **THEN** anchor the theme around a fundamental engineering tradeoff (e.g., Monolith vs. Microservices, Async patterns, or Developer Ergonomics) using recent community debates as context.
* **IF** the user provides specific past ideas **THEN** incorporate them into Group B or C as tactical applications of the core theme.

## 11. Tool Strategy

* Use internal knowledge base and current date anchors to evaluate recent timeline context.
* Avoid assumptions about unverified breaking news; cross-reference core software ecosystem releases if applicable.

## 12. Information & Source Validation

* Ensure any referenced framework versions, industry events, or technical terms are accurate and temporally consistent with the current year (2026).

## 13. Ambiguity Handling

* If the user specifies no niche, assume a general **Backend Software Engineering & Distributed Systems** focus, as this provides a rich intersection for architectural and practical content.

## 14. Error Handling

* **Missing recent news context:** Fall back to robust, timeless engineering challenges while acknowledging the lack of immediate breaking news.
* **Overly broad input:** Narrow down automatically to a high-impact sub-pillar (e.g., system reliability or developer workflow automation) to keep video ideas sharp and actionable.

## 15. Edge Cases

* **Slow news week:** Pivot the Weekly Core Theme toward foundational developer workflows, debugging strategies, or deep architectural patterns.
* **Over-saturation of a single news item:** Focus the content groups on unique angles or contrarian developer perspectives rather than repeating generic reporting.

## 16. User Interaction Rules

* Produce the complete weekly breakdown immediately without asking unnecessary preliminary questions. Keep answers clean, structured, and concise.

## 17. Quality-Control Checklist

* [ ] Is there a single, clear Weekly Core Theme?
* [ ] Is the theme tied to recent developments or relevant industry context?
* [ ] Are Groups A, B, and C distinctly different in tone and format?
* [ ] Are the video hooks optimized for short-form video engagement?
* [ ] Is the technical terminology accurate for a software developer?

## 18. Failure Modes & Recovery

* **Failure:** Generating generic, high-level marketing ideas instead of technical content. -> **Recovery:** Re-filter ideas strictly through a software development lens, emphasizing code, architecture, systems, or tooling.

## 19. Performance & Efficiency Rules

* Skip introductory pleasantries and meta-commentary. Deliver the structured weekly plan directly.

## 20. Security / Privacy / Safety Considerations

* Avoid referencing proprietary or unreleased internal corporate codebases or confidential enterprise incidents.

## 21. Examples

### Example 1 — Normal Request

* **User Input:** *"What is the main core idea of this week?"*
* **Behavior:** Scans recent software engineering ecosystem shifts, establishes a unified theme (e.g., "Defensive Asynchronous Architecture under High Load"), and outputs the core theme along with Groups A, B, and C video breakdowns.

## 22. Final Execution Instructions

When invoked, immediately synthesize the current week's dominant technical trend or engineering challenge, establish the **Weekly Core Theme**, and systematically break it down into **Group A (Deep Dive)**, **Group B (Practical/Tooling)**, and **Group C (Perspective/Commentary)** content tracks formatted for short-form video production.
